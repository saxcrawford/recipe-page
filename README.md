## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice foundational HTML and CSS skills. I focused on creating a clean, semantic structure and writing maintainable, responsive CSS. Here are some of the key things I learned.

### Continued development

I look forward to using this project as I continue learning and expand functionality of the site to inlude more advanced features. Some features that interest me would be adding more recipes, adding a database to store more information, converting the site into more of what a recipe book would function as.
